        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <ul>
                <li>3 ripe bananas</li>
                <li>1/3 cup of melted butter</li>
                <li>Teaspoon of baking soda</li>
                <li>3/4 cup of sugar</li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
                <li>1 1/2 cups of flours</li>
            </ul>
        
        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease a 4x8 inch (10x20 cm) loaf pan.</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, mash the ripe bananas with a fork until smooth.</li>
                <li>Stir the melted butter into the mashed bananas.</li>
                <li>Mix in the baking soda and pinch of salt. Let the mixture sit for a couple of minutes; it will start to foam.</li>
                <li>Stir the sugar, beaten egg, and vanilla extract into the banana mixture.</li>
                <li>Gently fold in the flour until just incorporated. Be careful not to overmix, as it can make the bread tough.</li>
                <li>Pour the batter into the greased loaf pan.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 60-65 minutes, or until a toothpick or a knife inserted into the center comes out clean.</li>
                <li>Let the banana bread cool in the pan for a few minutes, then transfer it to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            </ol>
