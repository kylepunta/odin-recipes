        <h2>Description</h2>
        
            <p>Apple crumble is a popular dessert that consists of baked apples with a sweet and crunchy topping. It is a simple and comforting dessert that is especially popular in British and American cuisine.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <p>For the filling:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>6-7 medium-sized apples (peeled, cored, and sliced)</li>
                <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For the crumble topping:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 cup of flour</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of rolled oats</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of brown sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of unsalted butter</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the sliced apples, granulated sugar, lemon juice, ground cinnamon, and ground nutmeg. Toss the apples to coat them evenly with the sugar and spices.</li>
                <li>Place the apple mixture in a greased 9x9-inch (23x23 cm) baking dish or a similar-sized ovenproof dish.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, make the crumble topping. Mix the all-purpose flour, rolled oats, brown sugar, and cold, diced butter. Use a pastry cutter, fork, or your hands to blend the ingredients until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. You can adjust the texture by adding more flour or oats if needed.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the crumble topping evenly over the apple mixture in the baking dish.</li>
                <li>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and bake for about 40-45 minutes or until the topping is golden brown and the apple filling is bubbling around the edges.</li>
                <li>Remove the apple crumble from the oven and allow it to cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                <li>Serve the apple crumble warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a dollop of whipped cream if desired.</li>
            </ol>
