        <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Bailey's cheesecake is a delicious dessert that combines the flavors of Bailey's Irish Cream liqueur with a classic cheesecake. It typically consists of a graham cracker or cookie crust, a creamy and rich cheesecake filling that's infused with Bailey's Irish Cream, and is often topped with a layer of chocolate ganache or a drizzle of additional Bailey's for extra flavor.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

            <p>For the crust:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups graham cracker crumbs</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of melted, unsalted butter</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For the cheesecake filling:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>3 (8-ounce) packages of cream cheese, softened</li>
                <li>1 cup of granulated sugar</li>
                <li>3 large eggs</li>
                <li>1/2 cup of Baileys</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
            </ul>

            <p>For the baileys ganache topping:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>1/2 cup of chocolate chips</li>
                <li>1/4 cup of heavy cream</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of Baileys</li>
            </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

            <ol>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 325°F (160°C).</li>
                <li>In a mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter. Mix until the crumbs are evenly coated with the butter.</li>
                <li>Press the crumb mixture into the bottom of a 9-inch (23 cm) springform pan. Use the back of a spoon or your fingers to create an even crust. Place the pan in the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, beat the softened cream cheese and sugar until smooth and creamy.</li>

                <li>Add the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each addition.</li>
                <li>Stir in the Baileys Irish Cream liqueur and vanilla extract until the mixture is well combined.</li>
                <li>Pour the cheesecake filling over the graham cracker crust in the springform pan.</li>
                <li>Place the cheesecake in the preheated oven and bake for about 45-50 minutes or until the edges are set and the center is slightly jiggly.</li>

                <li>Remove the cheesecake from the oven and let it cool to room temperature in the pan.</li>
                <li>Once the cheesecake is cool, place it in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight to set.</li>
                <li>In a small saucepan, combine the semisweet chocolate chips and heavy cream for the ganache. Heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
                <li>Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the Baileys Irish Cream liqueur.</li>

                <li>Let the ganache cool for a few minutes before pouring it over the chilled cheesecake.</li>
                <li>Use a spatula to spread the ganache evenly over the top of the cheesecake.</li>
                <li>Return the cheesecake to the refrigerator to allow the ganache to set for at least 30 minutes.</li>
                <li>Once the ganache is set, you can remove the sides of the springform pan and serve your Baileys cheesecake.</li>
            </ol>
